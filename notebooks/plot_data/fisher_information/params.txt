all data in this file was generated with the following parameters:

t = collect(-4:0.01:4)

t0 = 0
b0 = 0
rp = 0.5
d = 1
tin = d/3
u = [0.5, 0.5]
x0 = [t0, b0, rp, d, u]

log_s = -15
w0T = 0.1
log_w0 = log(w0T) - log(d)
println(log_w0)
log_wn = -10
ds0dlam = 0.005

wn = collect(-14:0.1:0)
bins = [0, 500, 1000]

for c_1 and c_2.dat I compute the uncertainty for r_p/r_* with the same parameters as above for ds0dlam = [0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02, 0.025, 0.03]
